Very simple build and run: very basic stuff. Just build it using the [DockerFile](Dockerfile) and run it however you

port adequately.

## üöß Tests

I'm still haven't figure it out yet. I will get there.


## TODO

- Better error handling (all application)
- Fix outgoing response on error
- Helper functions the handle parameters
- Add correct parameters to [OpenAPI file](api/endpoint_documentation.yaml) (and probably a error check)
- DTO to "clean" outgoing response
- Make the reference work in Gorm
- Probably a whole reorganization of the code (for a more idiomatic approach)
- Add a better logging packageMake created_at filed work on models
- Create GetTransactionList method on transaction_controller.go
- Probably controllers should Structs with the controllers package
- Add real filters to GetAccountList on account_controller.go
- Add method ToString to OperationModel
- All resources have basically no validation whatsoever
- Review DB middleware organization. (Probably move functions to methods or something like it)
- Transaction resource could use something like go routines to make queries simultaneously and save time
- For now the enumerator on the SQL query (OperationType) looks ok, but will have to change if more complex stuff appear (more columns?)
- mysql_connector could use a restructure. Move loose functions to methods of a "class" (struct)
- Put a path prefix on main.go regarding API's version for better version control of the API's client
